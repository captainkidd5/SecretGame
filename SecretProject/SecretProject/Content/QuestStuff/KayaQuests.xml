    <StartupSpeech>I've been feeling under the weather lately... Say! I know exactly what would help me get ship-shape in no time. Ever heard
    of a Sea-Slug Cocktail? The recipe's simple: Brinebulb Juice mixed with exactly one plump Sea-Slug. Bring me one and I'll teach ya a thing or two about the sea.</StartupSpeech>
