   <TextToWrite>Hey! Welcome to Town! # My name is Julian, I run the workshop.#
   I'd love some help if you're up for it. My blueprint table has a list of 
   prototypes which I still need materials for to research. # Once you've filled in the materials 
   for a particular invention let me know and I'll start working on it right away! `

   may require a fair bit of exploring to find, however.  `
